# Experiments

This folder is used to store notebooks, scripts, configs, and artifacts for hands-on zkML trials.

## Layout
- YYYY-MM-DD-topic/ for each experiment run (e.g., 2025-11-19-linear-mlp/).
- Inside each run folder, keep:
  - notes.md describing goals, datasets, and links back to research findings.
  - config.* or notebooks/scripts used to generate proofs.
  - outputs/ containing logs, witnesses, and proof/verifier artifacts.

Document any insight worth surfacing in 
research/findings.md, referencing the matching citation key.
